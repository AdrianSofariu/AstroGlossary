Welcome to the Next.js Astrophotography Learning Project! This project is a simple showcase of astrophotography images, built using the Next.js framework. It serves as a learning exercise to understand the basics of Next.js, including routing, dynamic image display, and styling. In this project, we are combining the beauty of astrophotography with the power of Next.js to create an interactive and visually appealing gallery.

Project Overview
Astrophotography captures the wonders of space, and this project showcases stunning images of galaxies, stars, nebulae, and more. Using Next.js, we built a responsive, performance-optimized website to display these photos. The project includes:

Static image pages with information about each astrophotograph.

A gallery with images dynamically fetched and displayed using Next.js API routes.

Custom styling and layout to make the images stand out.

Features
Dynamic Image Loading: Use of Next.js's Image component to automatically optimize image loading.

Responsive Design: The website is mobile-friendly and adjusts the layout based on screen size.

Static Site Generation (SSG): The static pages are generated at build time for fast performance.

Custom Page Routes: Each image has its dedicated page with additional details about the photograph and the photographer.
